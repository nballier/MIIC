# ASSIGNMENT: 

Each group will be granted access to a Google analytics sample dataset and write a report for the company. You can use as many figures as you wish to, but do not forget captions, comments and a table of figures for a document between 5 and 8 pages (plus appendix). 


**Outline**
---------
Here is a suggestion for the outline:
1. Descriptive statistics
Use visualisations techniques to summarise performances. Present the variables of your dataset, use quartiles and boxplot representations.
2. Slightly more advanced statistics
Correlation. Regression (linear models)
3. text mining
Try to apply 
- Compare the word clouds of the 20 less/more popular pages
4. qualitative analysis
Browse the actual pages, select relevant examples according to your statistical observations  
5. recommendations
6. conclusion 
7. acknowledgement
Explain who did what and how your team worked
8. Appendix : the commented R code you used
Comment your functions, source the URL you used for code snippets, specifically refer to the figures you inserted in your document  


**Marking criteria**
-----------------
- relevance of the observations for your dataset
- usefulness for the client 
- explicitness in your R code (for re-usability in a team)
